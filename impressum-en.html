                <h2>Liability for Contents</h2>
                <p>
                    As service providers, we are liable for our own content of these pages according to general laws. 
                    However, pursuant to §§ 8 to 10 of the Telemedia Act (TMG), we are not under obligation to monitor 
                    external information provided or stored on our website. Once we have become aware of a specific legal 
                    infringement, we will immediately remove the content in question. Any liability concerning this matter 
                    can only be assumed from the point in time at which the infringement becomes known to us.
                </p>

                <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents we have no control. 
                    Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for these external contents. The provider or operator of 
                    the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked 
                    for possible legal violations at the time they were linked to our site. Illegal contents were not 
                    identifiable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the contents of the linked 
                    pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a violation of the law.
                </p>

                <h2>Copyright</h2>
                <p>
                    The contents and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law. 
                    Duplication, processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization of such material beyond the 
                    scope of the copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator.
