                <h3>Microsoft Bookings – Appointment Booking System</h3>

                <h4>Provider and Data Processing Agreement</h4>
                <p>
                    For online appointment booking, we use Microsoft Bookings, a service of 
                    Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, 
                    Leopardstown, Dublin 18, D18 P521, Ireland (“Microsoft”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Microsoft processes the data described below on our behalf. 
                    We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Microsoft 
                    that ensures compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                </p>

                <h4>Data Processed During Appointment Booking</h4>
                <p>When booking an appointment through Microsoft Bookings, the following data is processed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First name, last name</li>
                    <li>Email address</li>
                    <li>Phone number (optional)</li>
                    <li>Company (optional)</li>
                    <li>Selected appointment (date and time)</li>
                    <li>Appointment description/concern (optional)</li>
                    <li>Technical data (IP address, device type, browser)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Purpose of Processing</h4>
                <p>
                    Data processing serves exclusively for appointment coordination, confirmation, 
                    and execution as well as contact before and after the appointment.
                </p>

                <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
                <p>
                    Processing is based on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR</strong> (contract initiation), when the 
                    appointment booking serves to prepare a specific order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR</strong> (legitimate interest), when 
                    the appointment booking serves for general consultation or an initial meeting. Our 
                    legitimate interest consists in efficient appointment coordination and avoidance 
                    of double bookings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Transfer to Third Countries (USA)</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important Notice:</strong> Depending on the configuration of our 
                    Microsoft 365 environment, your data may be processed on servers in the USA. 
                    According to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (ECJ, 
                    Schrems II ruling), the USA is considered an unsafe third country without adequate data protection level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data transfer to the USA is based on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EU Standard Contractual Clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR)</strong>, 
                    which Microsoft has concluded with us. You can find these here: 
                    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-eu-model-clauses" 
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft EU Model Clauses</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Additional guarantees:</strong> Microsoft has implemented additional technical 
                    and organizational measures to ensure the protection of your data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Your rights:</strong> You have the right to object to data transfer to the USA. 
                    In this case, you can alternatively arrange appointments by email 
                    (kontakt@supportedproject.de) or phone (+49 170 488 0284).
                </p>

                <h4>Storage Duration</h4>
                <p>
                    Appointment data is stored until the appointment is completed plus 3 months 
                    (for follow-up and billing). Deletion then follows, unless legal retention obligations exist.
                </p>

                <h4>Data Recipients</h4>
                <ul>

                    You have the right to:
