                    <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> These Terms of Service are for illustration purposes only and represent a draft. 
                    Actual contracts are made according to individual agreement. <strong>Final Terms of Service will be established after company formation.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>These Terms of Service apply exclusively to entrepreneurs (ยง 14 BGB German Civil Code).</strong></p>

                <h2>1. Scope of Application</h2>
                <p>
                    These General Terms and Conditions apply to all business relationships between SupportedProject 
                    (hereinafter "Contractor") and entrepreneurs in the sense of ยง 14 BGB (hereinafter "Client"). 
                    Deviating, conflicting or supplementary general terms and conditions of the Client shall only 
                    become part of the contract if and to the extent that we have expressly agreed to their validity.
                </p>

                    service agreements or project contracts.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Contract Formation</h2>

                    Offers by the Contractor are subject to change and non-binding unless expressly designated as binding. 
                    The contract is formed upon written confirmation of the order by the Contractor or upon commencement 
                    of service provision.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Fees and Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise agreed, remuneration is based on time and materials according to the current 
                    price list or individual agreement. Invoices are due for payment within 14 days of the invoice 
                    date without deduction.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Performance and Cooperation Duties</h2>
                <p>
                    The Client shall provide all necessary information, documents, and cooperation required for 
                    service provision. The Client is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of provided information.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property and Usage Rights</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon full payment, the Client receives comprehensive, exclusive, temporally and spatially 
                    unrestricted usage rights to work results; ownership of physical work pieces according to agreement. 
                    The Contractor retains the right to use general methods, processes, and know-how for other projects.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    The Contractor's liability for damages is limited to intent and gross negligence, except for 
                    injury to life, body or health, and breach of cardinal contractual duties. Liability for 
                    indirect damages, lost profits, and consequential damages is excluded.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>
                    Both parties undertake to treat confidentially all information received in connection with 
                    the contractual relationship and not to make it accessible to third parties without prior 
                    written consent.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Contract Duration and Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    Project contracts end with completion of the agreed services. Ongoing consulting relationships 
                    can be terminated by both parties with 4 weeks' notice to the end of the month, unless otherwise agreed.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
                <p>
                    German law applies exclusively. Place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this 
                    contractual relationship is Wuppertal, provided the Client is a merchant, legal entity under 
                    public law, or special fund under public law.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Severability Clause</h2>
                <p>
                    Should individual provisions of these Terms of Service be or become invalid, this does not 
                    affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The invalid provision shall be replaced 
                    by a valid provision that comes closest to the economic purpose.
                </p>
