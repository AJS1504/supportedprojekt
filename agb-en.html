                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

                <div class="notice" style="background-color: #e7f3ff; border: 1px solid #b3d9ff; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: #0066cc;">
                    <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> These Terms of Service are for illustration purposes only and represent a draft. 
                    Actual contracts are made according to individual agreement. <strong>Final Terms of Service will be established after company formation.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>These Terms of Service apply exclusively to entrepreneurs (§ 14 BGB German Civil Code).</strong></p>

                <h2>1. Scope of Application</h2>
                <p>
                    These General Terms and Conditions apply to all business relationships between SupportedProject 
                    (hereinafter "Contractor") and entrepreneurs in the sense of § 14 BGB (hereinafter "Client"). 
                    Deviating, conflicting or supplementary general terms and conditions of the Client shall only 
                    become part of the contract if and to the extent that we have expressly agreed to their validity.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Services</h2>
                <p>
                    The Contractor provides technical consulting services, project management, operational implementation support, 
                    and related technical services. The specific scope of services is determined in individual 
                    service agreements or project contracts.
                </p>

                <h3>2a. Service Delineation for Operational Implementation Support</h3>
                <p>
                    For operational implementation support engagements (flexible capacity expansion), the Contractor provides 
                    technical project services <strong>without assuming disciplinary management responsibility</strong> or authority 
                    to issue instructions to the Client's employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Contractor acts as an <strong>external technical resource in an advisory and implementing capacity</strong>. 
                    Final decisions, particularly regarding personnel, budget, or strategic matters, remain with the Client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Contractor is not liable for decisions made by the Client or its employees, even if such decisions 
                    were made based on the Contractor's technical recommendations.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Contract Formation</h2>
                <p>
                    Offers by the Contractor are subject to change and non-binding unless expressly designated as binding. 
                    The contract is formed upon written confirmation of the order by the Contractor or upon commencement 
                    of service provision.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Fees and Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise agreed, remuneration is based on time and materials according to the current 
                    price list or individual agreement. Invoices are due for payment within 14 days of the invoice 
                    date without deduction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All prices are subject to statutory VAT.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Performance and Cooperation Duties</h2>
                <p>
                    The Client shall provide all necessary information, documents, and cooperation required for 
                    service provision. The Client is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of provided information.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property and Usage Rights</h2>

                <h3>6.1 Copyright</h3>
                <p>
                    All work results created by the Contractor in the course of contract fulfillment 
                    (in particular concepts, documentation, analyses, reports, presentations) are protected 
                    by copyright. The copyright remains with the Contractor.
                </p>

                <h3>6.2 Granting of Usage Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon full payment of the remuneration, the Client receives an exclusive, temporally and 
                    spatially unlimited, transferable right to use all work results created within the scope 
                    of the contract. This includes in particular the right to reproduce, distribute, make publicly 
                    available, as well as to edit and further develop for own business purposes.
                </p>

                <h3>6.3 Physical Work Pieces</h3>
                <p>
                    Ownership of physical work pieces (e.g., printouts, data carriers, prototypes) transfers 
                    to the Client upon full payment, unless otherwise agreed.
                </p>

                <h3>6.4 Reference Right</h3>
                <p>
                    The Contractor reserves the right to use the project in anonymized form for reference purposes. 
                    A nominal mention of the Client only takes place with its prior written consent.
                </p>

                <h3>6.5 Pre-existing Rights and Know-how</h3>
                <p>
                    General methods, processes, procedures and other know-how that the Contractor has developed 
                    or develops independently of the specific contract remain the property of the Contractor and 
                    may be freely used by it for other projects.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Liability</h2>

                <h3>7.1 Liability for Breach of Essential Contractual Obligations</h3>
                <p>
                    The Contractor is liable without limitation for damages arising from injury to life, 
                    body or health that are based on an intentional or negligent breach of duty by the 
                    Contractor or its legal representatives or vicarious agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Contractor is liable without limitation for damages that are based on an intentional 
                    or grossly negligent breach of duty by the Contractor or its legal representatives or 
                    vicarious agents.
                </p>

                <h3>7.2 Liability for Simple Negligence</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event of a breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) 
                    through simple negligence, the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the 
                    contract in the first place and on the observance of which the Client may regularly rely, 
                    the Contractor's liability is limited in amount to the contractually typical, foreseeable 
                    damage, but at most to the coverage amount of the professional liability insurance 
                    (3,000,000 €).
                </p>

                <h3>7.3 Exclusion of Further Liability</h3>
                <p>
                    Any further liability of the Contractor does not exist. In particular, the Contractor 
                    is not liable for indirect damages, consequential damages or lost profits, unless these 
                    are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty.
                </p>

                <h3>7.4 Limitation Period</h3>
                <p>
                    Claims for damages become time-barred after twelve months from the statutory commencement 
                    of the limitation period, unless the statutory limitation periods apply in cases of intent 
                    or gross negligence.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>
                    Both parties undertake to treat confidentially all information received in connection with 
                    the contractual relationship and not to make it accessible to third parties without prior 
                    written consent.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Contract Duration and Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    Project contracts end with completion of the agreed services. Ongoing consulting relationships 
                    can be terminated by both parties with 4 weeks' notice to the end of the month, unless otherwise agreed.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
                <p>
                    German law applies exclusively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> For all disputes arising from this contract with merchants, 
                    legal entities under public law, or special funds under public law, the place of jurisdiction 
                    is the registered office of the Contractor (District Court Wipperfurth, Regional Court Cologne).
                </p>

                <h2>11. Severability Clause</h2>
                <p>
                    Should individual provisions of these Terms of Service be or become invalid, this does not 
                    affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The invalid provision shall be replaced 
                    by a valid provision that comes closest to the economic purpose.
                </p>
